# 🎯 VibeAuracle: The "God-Tier" Roadmap

## 🚀 High-Impact Core Features
- [ ] **Deep Project Context (RAG)**
    - Implement background indexing using `tree-sitter` for AST-aware snapshots.
    - Integrate local `sqlite-vec` for semantic search/recall.
    - Enable "Project-Wide Awareness" without manual file reading.
- [ ] **Autonomous "Self-Healing" Loop**
    - Tool: `verify_build` - Auto-detect build systems (Go, Make, NPM) and run tests.
    - Tool: `auto_fix` - Recursive error capture and self-correction loop until build passes.
- [ ] **MCP Bridge (Model Context Protocol)**
    - Build a high-performance MCP Client to connect external tool servers.
    - Support standard MCP servers for Database, Browser, and Documentation access.

## 🧠 System Intimacy & Intelligence
- [ ] **Real-Time Vibe Checks (Doctor)**
    - Proactive hardware monitoring (Switch to Cloud/Copilot if VRAM/CPU is throttled).
    - Environment dependency detection (Suggesting `gh`, `git`, or compilers when missing).
- [ ] **Swarm Mode Configuration**
    - Enable multi-agent collaboration (Security, Perf, Docs) debating solutions in the background.

## 🎨 UI/UX Refinement
- [ ] **Interactive Diff & Apply**
    - Real-time side-by-side terminal diff previews.
    - "Vibe Approval" mode with line-by-line reasoning explanations.
- [ ] **Keyboard-Centric Navigation**
    - Independent pane scrolling and advanced focus cycling.
