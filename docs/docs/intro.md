# Introduction

Welcome to **vibe auracle**, a Distributed, System-Intimate AI Engineering Ecosystem.

VibeAuracle unifies the terminal, the IDE, and the AI assistant into a single, keyboard-centric interface. It is built for engineers who value **system-intimacy**—where the AI isn't just a chatbot, but a co-pilot with deep access to your hardware, configuration, and environment.

## Key Principles

- **System-Intimate**: Real-time awareness of system resources, filesystem, and Git state.
- **Action-First**: Optimized for executing tasks directly rather than just talking about them.
- **Modular Agentic Runtimes**: Choose the best engine for your task—whether it's our artisan internal loop or the official GitHub Copilot SDK.
- **Keyboard-Centric**: Designed for speed and fluid terminal workflows.

## Main Features

- **Multi-Engine Support**: Switch between Vibe, Copilot SDK, and Custom agent personas.
- **Directory-Aware Sessions**: Robust PROJECT isolation using directory-hashed session IDs.
- **Deep Project Knowledge**: Persistent architectural indexing tied to Git commit history.
- **Proactive Recommendations**: Instantaneous follow-up actions and fixes based on context.
- **Zero-Config Onboarding**: Intelligent auto-switching to Copilot SDK when detected.
